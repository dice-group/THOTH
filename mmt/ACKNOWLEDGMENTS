Some of MMT's code is derived from great projects:

- Moses (LGPL) - Mostly the decoding.
- Irstlm (LGPLv2) - The starting point for the context adapted language model
- Fastaligner (Apache2) - The starting point for the incremental aligner
- Lucene (Apache2) - Reused tokenization and inverted index for the context analysis.

- Many others to add
